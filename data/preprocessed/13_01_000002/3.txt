SPECIAL NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBERS.
Delinquent subscribers for the past year,--that is,
from January 1, 1860, to January 1, 1861,--are re-
spectfully requested to remember our STANDING RULE,
by which their papers will be discontinued after Feb-
ruary 1, 1861, unless payment for the same be previous
ly sent in. We shall be extremely sorry to lose a
single subscriber in this manner, especially at this
crisis in our national affairs; but, as our printed terms
indicate that payment is to be made in advance, we are
sure if, instead of rigidly exacting it, we allow (as we
do a credit of fourteen months to delinquents, they can have
no cause of complaint when their papers are stopped
for omitting to make settlement; yet, with all this in-
dulgence, we have known various instances in which
such persons have taken this treatment almost as a
personal affront! What ideas have they of the sacred-
ness of contracts? And, surely, our subscription list
is always too limited to make us willingly lose a single
subscriber. Exceptional cases there will be, calling
for special consideration, but it is absolutely necessa-
ry that we should abide by the rule we have laid
down, to prevent losses which cannot be borne.
