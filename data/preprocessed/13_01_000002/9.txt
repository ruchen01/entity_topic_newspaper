THE DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION AND
THE "SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY."
a
It were a "consummation devoutly to be wished”
that the citizens of this country could be brought to
understand the true character of our boasted Union.
There are indications that Northern men, at least, will
see, before the present agitation subsides, the utter and
eternal incompatibility of freedom and slavery.
For the last quarter of a century, the changes have
been rung so incessantly on the "inestimable value of
the Union," the might of its power, the dread conse-
quences of its rupture, that we at the North have not
ventured to breathe a possibility of its disturbance,
however slightly, even to ourselves. In direct viola-
tion of our finer instincts, we have been persuaded to
press the per of slavery to our bosoms, and suffer it
to suck out our life-blood, as preferable to a dissolution
of the Union.
It is only within a few short weeks that most of us
have been made sensible of a marked modification of
our proclivities in this respect. The possibility, nay,
the probability of a dissolution, will we of nill we, has
been precipitated upon us by the South; and whatever
may have been our previous misgivings, as to dis-
union, we have no choice but to look its responsibili-
ties, if there be any, fully in the face. However
cheerfully Northern men would have sacrificed for its
maintenance in the past, under the impression of its
incalculable benefits, the facts we find ourselves pon-
dering in this season of anxiety force upon us all the
question, whether the Union, under any such circum-
stances as we have been compelled to behold it, is,
after all, so valuable a boon and worthy of so great
sacrifice.
A few weeks more of opportunity to observe the
Southern temper, as well as Southern weakness, in
the elements of either intellectual or national strength,
will not fail to convince most of us at the North that
the presence of the South in the Union can well be
dispensed with. It may be well for the South to un-
derstand, first and last, that the North, so far from
dreading her threats of secession, has occasion to re-
joice that she has taken the initiative, and proposes of
her own accord to go out of the Union, and thus re-
lieve us of the unpleasant necessity, at some future
time, of forcibly removing from the body politic so
hurtful an excrescence.
The North and the South, or freedom and slavery,
f are irreconcilable terms. Nothing like a Union in any
rational sense has existed, or can exist, in the face of
such facts as have been forced upon our contemplation
for twenty-five years past. Whatever efforts may be
made by the shuffling politician and statesman, un-
worthy the name, to force together what God and
nature intended should be forever antagonistic, will be
futile in all time to come.
Union by force of law or by external pressure, as
opposed to the laws of nature and reason, is inconsis-
tent with the intelligence, the freedom, the wealth and
y power of the North. Whatever may have been the
exigency existing when the thirteen States entered
the Confederacy for Union against foreign and in-
t, ternal aggression, no such necessity now exists with
n the free States, which of themselves are a power suffi-
cient to command the respect of every civilized coun-
try in the world. They are amply able to hold their
of place among the nations. They have the inherent
skill to make the most of their great natural advan-
tages, and could they once for all be entirely relieved
Eof the Law y , a new Inpuut arvat we
given to their energies, and the good effects would
g. soon be visible in a rapid growth in wealth, intelli-
- gence and population.
It is time the South were made sensible of the im-
re potency of her threats of dissolution; that she should
d open her eyes to the causes of her own ignorance,
d poverty and weakness; that she should be forced to
y understand, and if possible to be grateful for, the im-
D- mense advantages she has enjoyed in times past by her
connexion with the North; and that when bereft of
ne the vitality and support which she draws from union
with superior forces, she must soon sink to decay.
Let Northern men but once become conscious of their
strength and of their immeasurably superior advanta-
ges, and they would have less occasion to tremble be-
fore the phantom of dissolution. The cry of Union is
generated in pride, cowardice, and the consciousness
of a bad cause. Whence comes the necessity for eter-
nal preachment of the value of the Union, but that in
and the depths of our being we know the utter nonsense of
ial attempting to force together elements which, in their
essential nature, are eternally disjoined ?
Let the North duly appreciate its own strength, and
er- the justness of its cause. In no spirit of defiance.
nd but in the calmness of its own self-respect, let it afford
to be generous; and if the South, either from taste or
en by force of its geographical position, desires to try the
experiment of an independent existence, let it go with
of our good will. Let the separation, if it must come,
ci- be amicable; give them all the United States property
now located within their present boundaries, pay all
be the existing national debt, and then make them a rea-
sonable gratuity in ready cash to meet the smaller
contingencies connected with setting up the new
government. This would be a good outfit for a
Southern Confederacy, and all connexion of the North
with slavery forever ended. It would be the best bar-
m- gain the North ever made, and perhaps the poorest for
the South.
Let the great truth be made to stand prominent be-
fore the civilized world, that the Northern section of
this country alone embraces nearly all that is valua-
ble in a material, moral and intellectual point of view;
of that it is to the vastly superior civilization of the North
on that the United States are entitled to respect abroad
and at home; and if the character of a people, rather
than the extent of its domain, furnishes a criterion by
which to estimate its magnitude and power, then the
sixteen Northern States, once made independent of
slavery, are richer in all the elements of greatness
than the present thirty-three burdened with the cost of
use supporting an institution which can operate only de-
of cay and final destruction wherever it goes.
Yes, gentlemen of the South, take your cotton and
a your beloved "institution," and lay the foundation of
your Southern Confederacy; lash up your slaves ;
to draw on your own loins for their increase; swell by
every means the product of your one great staple; go
forward in your stupidity and ignorance in the labor
of exhaustion of your soils; establish your military
rule; tax yourselves most liberally, as you will be
obliged, to do to maintain vast naval and army estab-
lishments; enlist the flower of your new-fledged no-
bility, as well as your "mud-sill constitueney, in the
glorious task of preserving order within and without.
With your thousands of miles of frontier, both on the
land and the sea; with your vast plans for the con-
quest of Cuba and the dismemberment of the Mexi-
can Empire, the robbery and pillage of the present
territories of the United States, for the protection and
maintenance of the high road from the Rocky Moun-
tains to the Gulf of Mexieo, the reopening of the
net-
Atrican slave trade, for possible conflicts, not only
the
with your immediate neighbor,--s0 recently your con
partner, but with the mighty powers on the opposite
side of the Atlantic, to say nothing of the glorious
opportunities you offer to one or more Anglo-African
Garibaldis in your midst, and to John Browns on your
edi- borders and in the fastnesses of your mountains.
Go, we say, ye chivalric gentlemen, ye worshippers
vo. of yourselves, and of the "divine institution"! Go.
of and inaugurate your darling experiment of a Southern
ace. Confederacy, before which all Christendom mest
"pale her ineflectual fires." Give it a fair trial; and
288 when you have suffered enough, and become wiser,
In knock at the doors of your abused brethren of the
er; North, and we will not turn you away penniless. W

The Liberator.
No Union with Slaveholders !
BOSTON, FRIDAY, JANUARY 4, 1860.
SPECIAL NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBERS.
Delinquent subscribers for the past year,--that is,
from January 1, 1860, to January 1, 1861,--are re-
spectfully requested to remember our STANDING RULE,
by which their papers will be discontinued after Feb-
ruary 1, 1861, unless payment for the same be previous
ly sent in. We shall be extremely sorry to lose a
single subscriber in this manner, especially at this
crisis in our national affairs; but, as our printed terms
indicate that payment is to be made in advance, we are
sure if, instead of rigidly exacting it, we allow (as we
do a credit of fourteen months to delinquents, they can have
no cause of complaint when their papers are stopped
for omitting to make settlement; yet, with all this in-
dulgence, we have known various instances in which
such persons have taken this treatment almost as a
personal affront! What ideas have they of the sacred-
ness of contracts? And, surely, our subscription list
is always too limited to make us willingly lose a single
subscriber. Exceptional cases there will be, calling
for special consideration, but it is absolutely necessa-
ry that we should abide by the rule we have laid
down, to prevent losses which cannot be borne.
ANNUAL MEETING.
The Twenty-Ninth Annual Meeting of the MASSA-
CHUSETTS ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY will be held at
the TREMONT TEMPLE, in Boston, on THURSDAY
and FRIDAY, January 24th and 25th, commencing at
half past 10 o'clock, A. M.
The members and friends of the Society are ur-
gently requested to make the attendance on their part
larger than ever before seen since its formation. In
view of the position of the Anti-Slavery cause, and of
the state of the nation, it will be the most important
anniversary the Society has ever held.Troublous as
is the aspect of things, it is a sure indication that the
cause of impartial freedom is moving onward with ir-
resistible power, and that the day of jubilee is rapidly
approaching, to be succeeded by universal joy, peace
and prosperity. For nothing disturbs the repose,
deranges the business, assails the interest, dishonors
the character, and imperils the existence of the re-
public, but SLAVERY. Freedom, and the love of it,
and the advocacy of it, and the uncompromising sup-
port of it, without regard to color or race, can never
work ill to whatever is just, honest, noble, humane,
and Christ-like. It is not the Abolitionists, who sim-
ply espouse the cause of God's poor and needy and
oppressed, that it may go well with our land, but the
| Southern slaveholders and slave-breeders, who traffic
in human flesh and enslave even their own blood-kin-
dred, and who hate every thing that savors of liberty,
who have brought the nation into its present distracted
I and distressful condition; for theirs is the spirit which
chooses "rather to reign in hell than serve in heaven.”
Come, then, friends of freedom, to the Anniversary,
strong in the righteousness of your cause, serene and
undaunted in spirit, and resolute in your purpose to
seek the speedy removal of the cause of all our na-
tional suffering and danger!
Able and eloquent speakers will be present as usual.
[The list will be given hereafter.]
In behalf of the Society,
FRANCIS JACILSON, President.
ROBERT F. WALLCUT, Secretary.
THIRTY YEARS COMPLETED.
UL
1
We have completed thirty years of editorial life con
nected with the Liberator. We commence a new de-
cade with the same confidence in the principles we
espouse, the same assurance of success in the cause
we advocate, that we felt at the commencement of
our labors,-only greatly strengthened by the expe-
rience gained, and the progress made toward the goal
of final victory. It has been a long, desperate, and
| (humanly speaking) most unequal struggle with the
organized religious sentiment, the political power, the
combined wealth, the recognized respectability, the
s popular feeling, the business selfishness, the satanic
malignity, and the universal brutality and ruffianism
f of the country; but, from the hour the bugle of free-
dom first sounded its notes in favor of immediate and
universal emancipation, the movement has advanced
with slow but irresistible power, under Divine guid-
ance, confounding the wisdom of the wise, contemning
the might of the strong, taking the cunning in their
own craftiness, unmasking the hypocritical, swallow-
ing up all the rods of the magicians, breaking sects
and parties into fragments, vanquishing all opponents,
its poverty more than a match for all the wealth of
the land, its conscience outweighing Church and
State, its spirit sublime and unconquerable, its truths
self-evident, and its results glorious in the annals of
historic achievement;-and still,
« Against the wind, against the tide,
It steadies with upright keel,”
? outstripping all competition, and with the haven of
righteousness and peace full in view.
For thirty years, we have been the target of popular
scorn and violence, for imploring the nation to "undo
the heavy burdens, break every yoke, and let the op-
pressed go free”!
For thirty years, we have been ignominiously
branded as heretic and infidel, disorganizer and fanatic,
because we have declared chattel slavery to be dia-
metrically at war with the spirit and teachings of
Christianity, and that into the true Church enter nei-
ther the enslavers nor despisers of their fellow-men!
For thirty years, we have subjected ourselves to
outlawry in all the slaveholding States, and have had
no common country to recognize our rights and ac-
cord to us equal privileges, because we have main-
tained that liberty ought to be "proclaimed through-
Tout all the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof T
For thirty years, we have been held up to public
abhorrence as a monster of iniquity, and represented
fas quite unfit to live, because we have "remembered
- those in bonds as bound with them," refusing to com-
promise their cause, and carrying out in their behalf
- the Golden Rule !
- For thirty years, the Abolitionists have been mobbed
in city, town and village-misunderstood, misrepre-
sented, calumniated, caricatured, ostracised-injured
in business, and cut off from all preferment-because
f they have endorsed the language of JOHN WESLEY,
- that “Slavery is the sum of all villany," and believed
f with THOMAS JEFFERSON, in regard to the enslaved
at the South, that “one hour of their bondage is
fraught with more misery than ages of that which we
rose in rebellion to oppose"-and trembled with him,
when they “reflected that God is just, and that his
t justice cannot sleep forever"!
The “head and front of our offending,' and of theirs,
s hath this extent-no more."
So stands the record of impartial history.
But the Anti-Slavery cause being of heaven, not of
men, and guarded and defended by the arm of Om-
nipotence, no weapon formed against it has been able
to prosper. In vain have been, and will be, all com-
promises between the North and South. The "irre-
y conflict” sweeps everything before it,
the fulminations of priestcraft, and
All Union-saving

LETTER FROM DR. A. BROOKE.
MARLBORO', Ohio, Dec. 14th, 1860.
MY DEAR FRIEND,--Your remarks upon the late ri
mob in Boston, in the Liberator of the 7th, include the in
following passage:
"It way our impression that the Convention would prove 1
comparatively a failure, as the Call did not emanate from a
source calculated to carry any personal weight, and as no
conference or consultation whatever was had with the long-
tried advocates of the anti-slavery cause, who, if they had in
been consulted, would have suggested a very different mode
of procedure, and who had nothing to do with it directly."
Inasmuch as you acknowledge “the right of the
young men," alluded to, “to call the meeting in their
own way,” is there not something needlessly ungra- +
cious, to say the least, in such a remark, under the cir-
cumstances? While perilling much in a struggle for
free speech for all, and smarting under undeserved vio-
lence, was it wise towards our cause to enter a dis-
claimer of any part of their course, which could not
be condemned as a moral delinquency? Is there not
reason to feel encouraged by, and to encourage every
evidence of uncompromising hostility to slavery, ,
whether the actors in it pronounce our shibboleth, or
ask our opinion of the “how to do it," or no?
Yours, with true regard, A. BROOKE.
REPLY. We deem it neither unfair nor improper to
"let every tub stand upon its own bottom," or to state
facts truly as they exist. The reason why we used
the explanatory language, referred to by Dr. Brooke,
was, that the meeting at the Temple was falsely repre-
seuled by the press and telegraph to have been a
"Garrisonian” convention, and especially under the
guidance of Mr. Phillips and Mr. Garrison, who were
taunted with cowardice (!) by the Courier for not hav-
ing been present. While we shrink from no responsi-
bility of our own, we are not willing to have that of
others thrust upon us against our consent. We fully
vindicated the right of those who called the meeting
at the Temple to do so, against all disorderly interrup-
tion, and have ever since been assiduously endeavor-
ing to deepen the infamy of those who riotously broke
it up, by recording our own views, and the sentiments
of various manly journals in different parts of the
country. We still think, however, that it would have
been not only courteous, but judicious, on the part of
the young men who signed the call, to have conferred
directly with those older in the struggle, as to the best
mode of procedure upon an anniversary calculated to
arouse the demon-spirit of slavery, far and wide.
There can be no good objection to "personal weight,"
or to the presentation of the most influential names,
when these can be obtained in the cause of ostracised
liberty. Nevertheless, it is for each and all to labor as
they may. Our only aim was, to make a simple ex-
planation in order to correct a wide-spread misrepre-
sentation. What would have been a comparative fail-
ure, has resulted in a meeting for the whole country,
commanding millions of hearers, owing to the efforts
of Messrs. Fay, Howe, and their mobocratic associates.
So kind Heaven-
« From seeming evil, still educes good.”
FAMINE IN KANSAS.
With all the relief that has yet been extended, the
famine in Kansas continues to be sorely felt, and
thousands are in a state of destitution closely border-
ing upon starvation. The number is estimated at
thirty or forty thousand. This is truly appalling; for
they can realize nothing for themselves until another
harvest. On our last page, we give a highly into
ing Stter from Mr Dan int, dated" Atchison,
Kansas, Dec. 20, 1860," in which some painful and
heart-moving facts are communicated respecting this
terrible visitation, and a strong appeal made to East-
ern benevolence, which we are sure will not be made
in vain. The most reliable arrangements have been
made in the Territory to sacredly and judiciously dis-
tribute the charities given, according to the necessities
of the parties presenting themselves for relief; so that
there need be no apprehension on that point. Think
of a bare-footed population in the inclemency of win-
ter, to say nothing of rags instead of clothing for a
covering!
Below is a private note from our esteemed friend,
Col. Whiting of Concord, Mass., characteristic of his
spirit, which we publish in this connection as an in-
centive for others to “ go and do likewise.” Blessings
on the heads of the juvenile benefactors in Concord
of the suffering people in Kansas !
CONCORD, Dec. 16, 1860.
DEAR FRIEND,-Reading in the Liberator of the
7th inst. an affecting account of the sufferings of the
people at Neosho Falls, Woodson County, Kansas, I
thought it would be well to read it to our Sunday
School, which I accordingly did. We then and there
voted to take up a collection on the 16th inst. It
amounts to $10.62. It would have done your heart
good to see the bright eyes of the dear little children
sparkle when the amount collected was announced to
them, because it is so much more blessed to be
able to give than to (be obliged to) receive.
May God in mercy grant that every one who has
the means may be kind and generous to the poor suf-
ferers, not only in Kansas, but wherever they may be !
Yours, truly, WM. WHITING.
f
FUGITIVE SLAVES AND THE LIBERTY ACT.
NUMBER I.
-
d
d
There will, undoubtedly, be an attempt made, in this
State and the other States, to repeal the so-called
Liberty Act, with a view of conciliating the South,
and preventing its secession. It has been stated in
the newspapers, recently, by high legal authority, that
the Liberty Act of this State is unconstitutional,--as
conflicting with the National Constitution, and for
this reason should be immediately repealed. How
this may be, I do not know, and I will not undertake
to call in question the legal opinions of men so emi
nent as lawyers, as many of these gentlemen un
doubtedly are.
I take, however, an entirely different ground from
them, and would prevent the execution of the Fugi
tive Slave Law, whether it is constitutional or not, and
whether the Liberty Act of this State is a violation o
this provision of the National Constitution or not.
The ground I take—and I think it is an impregnable
one-is, that the States had no right to make this pro
vision a part of this Constitution, nor adopt it; and
that it is entirely null and void, as such. I will now
endeavor to prove the position I thus take. And to
do this, I will review the decision of the Suprem
Court of this State, in the case of the slave Med
which came before them more than twenty year
since, and which decision was given by Judge Shaw
in his own language. I say, then, that there is a
evident inconsistency, in principle, between the law a
it was decided by the Court in that case, in referenc
to slaves brought here voluntarily by their masters, an
the law in relation to slaves who are fugitives fron
other States, under the provision of the National Con
stitution. In the former case, the Court decided tha
they are entitled to their liberty immediately, and i
the latter case, that they must be returned back agai
to a state of slavery. To perceive this inconsistenc
in principle, we must examine the ground upon whic
they are declared to be free when coming with th
consent of their master, and see whether these ground
do not equally apply when they are fugitives froi
another State. The Court, in giving their opinion i
that case, say :
* Without making inquiry further, it is sufficient for ti
purpose before us, that by the Constitution, adopted
1780, slavery was abolished in Massachusetts, on the grou
that it is contrary to natural right and the plain principles
justice. The terms of the 1st article of the Declaration
Rights are plain and explicit,-All men are born free ax
equal, and have certain natural, essential and inalionab
rights, among which, are the right of enjoying and d
fonding their lives and liberty, that of acquiring, posses
ing and protecting property. It would be difficult to sele
words more precisely adapted to the abolition of neg
slavery."
Now, if these were the grounds upon which slaver
1s

vas abolished in this State, and can no longer exist T
here, why do not they apply as well to fugitive slaves
as any other? Why is it not as "contrary to natural
right and the plain principles of justice” to hold them
n bondage, or return them to bondage, as slaves who tl
have come here by the consent of their masters ? u
These principles apply to the system of slavery in T
tself, and not to the mode by which they came into
Ehe State. The rights of the slave must be the same e
In both cases.
But in reply to this it may be said, that, in the case b
of fugitive slaves, the State of Massachusetts has, by t
adopting the National Constitution, bound themselves g
to recognize slavery in the Southern States, so far as
to deliver up fugitive slaves when claimed by their h
masters, but have not bound themselves to deliver up t
slaves who come here under other circumstances. I
But the question recurs again, what right have theyt
to bind themselves by adopting a Constitution contain-
ing such a provision "against natural right and the
plain principles of justice"? What right have they
to assume dominion over the lives and liberty and
welfare of a race of men who were not parties to this t
Constitution, and who had no voice, either jn: fixing
its provisions or making the laws under these pro-
visions—who were not represented in the Conven- 1
tion that framed it, or in Congress who made laws un-
der it? If there is any truth in the assertion made in
the Declaration of Independence, "That all just laws
proceed from the consent of the governed,” they are
certainly not bound by these laws, for they never gave
their consent to them in any manner, either directly
or through their representatives. And I would further
ask, what right had the States to bind themselves by
an instrument, which, under certain circumstances, re-
quires them to rob a fellow-man of all his rights, per-
sonal, domestic and civil, and to reduce him again to
the condition of a brute and a chattel? If they have
no right by the Constitution and laws of Massachu-
setts, grounded upon "natural right and the plain
principles of justice," to deprive a fellow-being of all
his rights, and treat him as a slave, they have no right
to become parties to a National Constitution which is
intended to produce this effect. This principle will
apply to the one as well as the other.
But it is said by the Court, in this case, that the Con-
stitution of the United States partakes of the nature
of a treaty between foreign powers, and that it would
be perfectly competent for one foreign power to stipu-
late by a treaty to deliver up the fugitive slaves of
another foreign power. This position of the Court I
would respectfully dispute. In my judgment, it is
never competent for one foreign power to bind them-
selves by a treaty to do that to another foreign power,
which the party stipulating confesses will, in its con-
sequences, lead to something "against natural right
and the plain principles of justice." If it were com-
petent, it would be competent for a nation to do what
is an acknowledged wrong, and a violation of justice.
The plain distinction in the case appears to me to be
this : that though a government has no right forcibly
to interfere with the laws or institutions of another
State, within that State, though such laws or institu-
tions may be unjust and oppressive, yet it ought not,
in any way, to coöperate with the other State within
its own jurisdiction and territory, in the support of
such institutions and laws. It is not bound to reform
and purify the laws or institutions of another State of
their injustice and evils, except by the exercise of a
moral influence; but it is bound in any way to exe-
cute these laws, or uphold these institutions, within its
own dominiono Tt : Lotu sake other na-
tions do right, but it is obliged itself not to do wrong.
Again : see the absurdity which follows from con-
sidering a man a slave who comes into Massachu-
setts as a fugitive, and a freeman when brought here
by his master. In the former case, he is considered
a mere chattel-a movable--personal property attached
to his master, which may be reclaimed as a stray
horse. In the latter, he is considered a freeman, en-
titled to all the rights of a freeman. Yes, the same
individual, having the same natural rights, which he
has never forfeited or transferred, is to depend for the
character, in which he shall be treated, whether as a
horse or a man, upon the mere mode by which he
shall have found his way into the State—a circum-
stance not at all affecting the fact whether he is a hu-
man being, endowed with all the faculties of a human
being, and entitled to all the rights of a human being.
If such a doctrine is not absurd and destitute of sense,
and such as never would have entered into the head
of anybody, but those who are wedded to the artificial
principles of law, I do not know what would be such.
I have often thought that the habit of studying the
law has an effect in obscuring the mind from the per-
ception of the clear principles of common sense and
common justice, which are so readily felt and under-
y stood by people in other occupations. Lawyers often
e make artificial distinctions, where no one else would
think of making them, and carry the subtleties of
special pleading into the great and fundamental princi-
ples of justice. A man may make a good lawyer, and a
| miserable statesman. The one allows his reason to be
shackled by the rigid and often arbitrary rules and
principles of law, in all the views he takes of great
national questions. The other takes a broad and ex-
panded view of these questions, in reference to their
influence upon the welfare of society, and the great
principles of justice and humanity. No other circum-
stances will explain the illiberal and irrational views
1. which pervade the speeches of many of our legislators
in Congress, and the opinions of many of our distin-
guished lawyers and judges. There are views ex-
is pressed, in many of these speeches and these opinions,
d which are totally abhorrent to all the first principles of
2. justice, and even to the plain principles of common
n sense. These persons talk with great flippancy about
at the rights of individuals to hold property in human
s beings, and the political rights of States to determine
their own institutions and laws, while they totally ig-
nore, and treat with the utmost contempt, the doctrine
that these human beings have any property in their
i own bodies and souls, and the same right to make use
1 of their faculties for the acquisition of other kinds of
property as they themselves have. They can prate
m about civil rights, which are the mere creatures of a
i political frame of government, but disregard, totally,
those natural and inalienable rights which belong to
of the whole human family, whether black or white,
which are the gift of God, and inherent in our very
natures.

THE DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION AND
THE "SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY."
a
It were a "consummation devoutly to be wished”
that the citizens of this country could be brought to
understand the true character of our boasted Union.
There are indications that Northern men, at least, will
see, before the present agitation subsides, the utter and
eternal incompatibility of freedom and slavery.
For the last quarter of a century, the changes have
been rung so incessantly on the "inestimable value of
the Union," the might of its power, the dread conse-
quences of its rupture, that we at the North have not
ventured to breathe a possibility of its disturbance,
however slightly, even to ourselves. In direct viola-
tion of our finer instincts, we have been persuaded to
press the per of slavery to our bosoms, and suffer it
to suck out our life-blood, as preferable to a dissolution
of the Union.
It is only within a few short weeks that most of us
have been made sensible of a marked modification of
our proclivities in this respect. The possibility, nay,
the probability of a dissolution, will we of nill we, has
been precipitated upon us by the South; and whatever
may have been our previous misgivings, as to dis-
union, we have no choice but to look its responsibili-
ties, if there be any, fully in the face. However
cheerfully Northern men would have sacrificed for its
maintenance in the past, under the impression of its
incalculable benefits, the facts we find ourselves pon-
dering in this season of anxiety force upon us all the
question, whether the Union, under any such circum-
stances as we have been compelled to behold it, is,
after all, so valuable a boon and worthy of so great
sacrifice.
A few weeks more of opportunity to observe the
Southern temper, as well as Southern weakness, in
the elements of either intellectual or national strength,
will not fail to convince most of us at the North that
the presence of the South in the Union can well be
dispensed with. It may be well for the South to un-
derstand, first and last, that the North, so far from
dreading her threats of secession, has occasion to re-
joice that she has taken the initiative, and proposes of
her own accord to go out of the Union, and thus re-
lieve us of the unpleasant necessity, at some future
time, of forcibly removing from the body politic so
hurtful an excrescence.
The North and the South, or freedom and slavery,
f are irreconcilable terms. Nothing like a Union in any
rational sense has existed, or can exist, in the face of
such facts as have been forced upon our contemplation
for twenty-five years past. Whatever efforts may be
made by the shuffling politician and statesman, un-
worthy the name, to force together what God and
nature intended should be forever antagonistic, will be
futile in all time to come.
Union by force of law or by external pressure, as
opposed to the laws of nature and reason, is inconsis-
tent with the intelligence, the freedom, the wealth and
y power of the North. Whatever may have been the
exigency existing when the thirteen States entered
the Confederacy for Union against foreign and in-
t, ternal aggression, no such necessity now exists with
n the free States, which of themselves are a power suffi-
cient to command the respect of every civilized coun-
try in the world. They are amply able to hold their
of place among the nations. They have the inherent
skill to make the most of their great natural advan-
tages, and could they once for all be entirely relieved
Eof the Law y , a new Inpuut arvat we
given to their energies, and the good effects would
g. soon be visible in a rapid growth in wealth, intelli-
- gence and population.
It is time the South were made sensible of the im-
re potency of her threats of dissolution; that she should
d open her eyes to the causes of her own ignorance,
d poverty and weakness; that she should be forced to
y understand, and if possible to be grateful for, the im-
D- mense advantages she has enjoyed in times past by her
connexion with the North; and that when bereft of
ne the vitality and support which she draws from union
with superior forces, she must soon sink to decay.
Let Northern men but once become conscious of their
strength and of their immeasurably superior advanta-
ges, and they would have less occasion to tremble be-
fore the phantom of dissolution. The cry of Union is
generated in pride, cowardice, and the consciousness
of a bad cause. Whence comes the necessity for eter-
nal preachment of the value of the Union, but that in
and the depths of our being we know the utter nonsense of
ial attempting to force together elements which, in their
essential nature, are eternally disjoined ?
Let the North duly appreciate its own strength, and
er- the justness of its cause. In no spirit of defiance.
nd but in the calmness of its own self-respect, let it afford
to be generous; and if the South, either from taste or
en by force of its geographical position, desires to try the
experiment of an independent existence, let it go with
of our good will. Let the separation, if it must come,
ci- be amicable; give them all the United States property
now located within their present boundaries, pay all
be the existing national debt, and then make them a rea-
sonable gratuity in ready cash to meet the smaller
contingencies connected with setting up the new
government. This would be a good outfit for a
Southern Confederacy, and all connexion of the North
with slavery forever ended. It would be the best bar-
m- gain the North ever made, and perhaps the poorest for
the South.
Let the great truth be made to stand prominent be-
fore the civilized world, that the Northern section of
this country alone embraces nearly all that is valua-
ble in a material, moral and intellectual point of view;
of that it is to the vastly superior civilization of the North
on that the United States are entitled to respect abroad
and at home; and if the character of a people, rather
than the extent of its domain, furnishes a criterion by
which to estimate its magnitude and power, then the
sixteen Northern States, once made independent of
slavery, are richer in all the elements of greatness
than the present thirty-three burdened with the cost of
use supporting an institution which can operate only de-
of cay and final destruction wherever it goes.
Yes, gentlemen of the South, take your cotton and
a your beloved "institution," and lay the foundation of
your Southern Confederacy; lash up your slaves ;
to draw on your own loins for their increase; swell by
every means the product of your one great staple; go
forward in your stupidity and ignorance in the labor
of exhaustion of your soils; establish your military
rule; tax yourselves most liberally, as you will be
obliged, to do to maintain vast naval and army estab-
lishments; enlist the flower of your new-fledged no-
bility, as well as your "mud-sill constitueney, in the
glorious task of preserving order within and without.
With your thousands of miles of frontier, both on the
land and the sea; with your vast plans for the con-
quest of Cuba and the dismemberment of the Mexi-
can Empire, the robbery and pillage of the present
territories of the United States, for the protection and
maintenance of the high road from the Rocky Moun-
tains to the Gulf of Mexieo, the reopening of the
net-
Atrican slave trade, for possible conflicts, not only
the
with your immediate neighbor,--s0 recently your con
partner, but with the mighty powers on the opposite
side of the Atlantic, to say nothing of the glorious
opportunities you offer to one or more Anglo-African
Garibaldis in your midst, and to John Browns on your
edi- borders and in the fastnesses of your mountains.
Go, we say, ye chivalric gentlemen, ye worshippers
vo. of yourselves, and of the "divine institution"! Go.
of and inaugurate your darling experiment of a Southern
ace. Confederacy, before which all Christendom mest
"pale her ineflectual fires." Give it a fair trial; and
288 when you have suffered enough, and become wiser,
In knock at the doors of your abused brethren of the
er; North, and we will not turn you away penniless. W
